<summary>Family tree - a closer look into the past of oneâ€™s family. The memories of the ancestors</summary>
<h5> 
<p>At different periods of our lives, all of us have a desire to learn more about our ancestors: who they were, where and when they lived, what was their occupation, what they believed, whom did they love? Fragmentary information about ancestors appears in our lives from our own memories, from the stories of parents about their relatives, family legends or diaries, which were lucky to survive to the present day. What drives us in our pursuit of learning about them, and therefore about our shared past? Perhaps the fact is that we are their continuation, and the more we know about them, the better we understand ourselves, our goals and motives. People were always fascinated by reading historical chronicles, learning about the lives of people who often had nothing to do with them. We, however, have an opportunity to learn about the lives of our own ancestors. To learn about the lives of those we heard about from our elders, or even those who were forgotten by the living. What remains of a person in this world after he dies? Only the memories kept by his contemporaries and descendants remain. He is alive, while his memory lives on, and he dies along with the last person who remembers him. Dash between dates of birth and death is the mark that one makes on the world, and how much this little sign can tell about a person, depends heavily on the researcher.</p>

<p>Historically, it was very difficult or even impossible for a common person to find any detailed information about his ancestors.  Usually, people had no idea where they could find relevant records and what was remained of it. Nowadays, due to the information revolution, the access to adequate data has significantly simplified. Some people think that if they do not have information about their ancestors, the situation cannot be changed, because so much time has passed, and there is no one who can tell stories about past days. However, practice shows that every person leave traces, which, being carefully examined, can tell us surprisingly a lot about his past. You have the opportunity to write a historical chronicle of your own family, to be proud of the achievements of its distinguished representatives who left their mark on history. Perhaps you will be horrified with the crimes of your great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers, condemn their misconduct or alternatively be touched by their love stories. Find out who they were: aristocrats or clergy, peasants, townspeople, or merchants. After all, your ancestors were smarter, stronger and luckier than many of their contemporaries, because there are descendants who remember them. The study of family history is an exciting interactive detective story, which we would be happy to help you write...</p>

<summary>Archival research on people from the countries of the Baltic Rim in the Northwestern region of Russia</summary>
<h5>
<p>During several centuries, immigrants from other countries served the Russian Empire. Some came here for a short period at the invitation of the authorities and enlisted in the army, in the fleet or were employed as civilians. Others arrived in search of a better life and remained here forever. They became professors, teachers, and doctors, settled down to married lives and connected their future with the new country. For 300 years, large communities of Germans, Swedes, Finns, Poles, Dutch, Latvians, Estonians and people from other countries lived in Saint Petersburg and around the city. They moved to the capital of the flourishing empire, which was in need of an influx of new people. If your ancestors were among them, then it is likely that we would be able to trace their life journeys for you. A large amount of documents has been preserved in federal, municipal, departmental, university, church, military and naval archives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the great shocks of the previous century caused tremendous damage to archival records in Russia. As a result of three revolutions and two devastating wars, many archives were partially or completely destroyed. The surviving records are scattered, poorly organized, for the most part not digitized, which makes them very difficult to find.  At your request, we are ready to gather an information about your ancestors and provide it to you in a systematized form.</p>

<summary>Stemma community â€“ about our work and us</summary>
<h5>
<p>Stemma community is a group of researchers who are for many years professionally engaged in genealogical studies and archival searches. Our high experience in searching for documents, together with best practices in analysis of historical records allow us to provide for you as detailed as possible biography of your ancestors. We focus not only on finding out bare dates and facts of a personâ€™s life, but also on collecting the most complete information about your past relatives. We look through registers of tenants, loan and collateral documents, court records, medical histories, certificates of ownership, student files, military service records, merchant guild records and craft guild records. After summarizing information from all these sources, it is often possible to reconstruct a detailed story of a personâ€™s life, and give life to his or her image.</p>

<summary>Providing the results of research â€“ what you will get</summary>
<h5>
<p>The results of the search depend on the adequacy and accessibility of archival records found. At the very least we will provide you with a timeline of key events in the life of your ancestor (i.e. dates of birth, marriage and death), as well as brief information about his or her spouse, children, parents and place of burial. At most, we will retrace the history of your past relatives. You will learn about where and how they studied and worked, what they owned, you will find out why they were awarded or sentenced, whether they borrowed from banks or were lenders themselves, you will understand, what shaped their lives. Furthermore, after receiving the information about ancestorâ€™s parents, you can continue to search to learn more about your earlier ancestors.</p>

<ul>
<li>A brief summary of facts, which are provided with references to archival records.</li>
<li>A feature story, where facts about your ancestor are put into historical context. This type of report is also provided with references to archival records.</li>
