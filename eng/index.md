<h5> Archival search of people from the Baltic countries in the North-West of Russia

Others came in search of a better life and remained here forever, became professors, teachers, doctors, started a family and connected their future with a new country.
For 300 years, numerous diasporas of Germans, Swedes, and Finns have lived in Russia, Poles, Dutch, Latvians, Estonians and people from other countries who flocked to the capital of the empire, St. Petersburg and its environs, the center of attraction is dynamically developing state, in need of an influx of new people. If among them were yours ancestors, then, most likely, we will be able to trace for you their life path. Preserved a large amount of information in various sources - federal, municipal,
departmental, university, church, military and naval archives.

Unfortunately, the great shocks of the previous century caused tremendous damage to the archival business in Russia. As a result of three revolutions and two devastating wars, many archives were partially or completely destroyed. The preserved information is scattered, poorly systematized, for the most part not digitized, which makes it very difficult to find.
We offer a search and systematization of this information to provide you with the most convenient format.
